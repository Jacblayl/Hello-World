public class Main { 
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello World");
}
}

/* 
on line(1) remember Main needs to be capitalized
on line(2) remember String needs to be capitalized
on line(3) remember System needs to be capitalized
(after all of that it is basically rote memory to remember where to put the curly brackets and such)

Carry on and goodluck coding!
