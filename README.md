# Hello-World

Hello! Jacob here, a little bit about myself. I love the prospect of coding yet I haven't yet chosen a language to follow closely. This is why i'm here, to learn as much about Java as I possibly can.

I love to comment ((//) or (/* */)) in my code just so I can go back and review what thought process I had at the time. This allows me to experiment with different ways to code.

Best of luck!

Jacob
